I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Thomas Lord Department of Computer Science at the University of Southern California. My background includes the fields of software engineering, game development, and game AI. In my research I develop techniques for quality assurance of video games, leveraging a combination of program analysis techniques and game playing agents. My work is grounded in current game development practices and game engines, and evaluated via large-scale experiments across many existing games.
